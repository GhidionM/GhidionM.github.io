    <p>Hello! My name is Ghidion Ghirmay, I live in Toronto,Canada, and I am a student at Trios College, 
      where I am currently pursuing a Web Development Fundamentals program.<br>My passion for technology and 
      web development drives me to continuously learn and enhance my skills in this dynamic field.<br>
      Throught my studies, I wish to gain a solid foundation in various programming languages and frameworks, 
      including HTML,CSS, JS and Java..etc.<br>
